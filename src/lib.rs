//! This crate contains the type Letter<T>. It is supposed to be a container for signed data.
//! You can create signed data either from a ed25519 key or using a `Certificate`.
//! 
//! For example, when you generate a ephermeral keypair, you sign your public key by creating a
//! Letter<PublicKeyType> and send that over the network. The other end can then validate the
//! Letter and knows that you own that certificate, and if the other end trusts that certificate
//! (for example, by signing your certificate with the master keypair), it knows, that the
//! sent public key is really yours.
